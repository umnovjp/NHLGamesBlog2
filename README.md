# NHLGamesBlog2
Attempted to create ah more advanced game blog than NHLGameBlog before NHL season starts. But first hurdle is that I cannot use require on the client side as I initially planned. Looking for more options. index.js file has just 200+ lines. So I can do 1000 lines more. But maybe I will drop this one.
